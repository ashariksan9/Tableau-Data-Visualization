# Data Visualization With Tableau

This repository showcases a project focused on exploring and visualizing data using **Tableau**. The goal is to uncover insights and communicate findings effectively through impactful visual representations.

## Project Overview 📝

In this project, we leverage **Tableau** to analyze and visualize data, aiming to extract meaningful insights and present them effectively. The key steps in this project include:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Loading the dataset and performing an initial exploration to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Creating various visual representations such as bar charts, geographic maps, and other charts to analyze data patterns and trends.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Interpreting the visualizations to extract insights that can drive business decisions and strategies.

## Background Problem 🧐

Over the past few months, the store's revenue has remained stagnant, showing no significant increase or decrease. To ensure sustainable growth, it is crucial to identify strategies that can help increase revenue. A business must continually optimize its strategies to break through stagnation and drive consistent growth.

## Problem Statement 📌

**Specific:** The store's revenue has been stagnant, and an increase is required.

**Measurable:** The Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) should increase by 30%.

**Achievable:** This can be achieved by increasing the average order value per customer on the website.

**Relevant:** Raising the average order value per customer will directly impact GMV and drive revenue growth.

**Time-bound:** The goal is to achieve a 30% increase in GMV within one month.

### **Main Problem Statement:**
Increase the store's revenue by boosting GMV by 30% within the next month. This can be done by increasing the average order value per customer.
